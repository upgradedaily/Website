      <p>Ever feel like your brain is in a fog? Like no matter how hard you try to push forward, your mind just won’t cooperate?</p>
      <p>There's a quick, science-backed way to reset that mental state — in just 60 seconds. It’s called a pattern interrupt: a psychological technique that jolts your brain out of its current loop.</p>
      <p>Try this: stand up, shake out your body for five seconds, clap loudly three times, and then say out loud: “Let’s go.” Your brain shifts from passive to active mode. You’ve created a physiological and mental reset button.</p>
      <p>This technique is used by peak performers, Navy SEALs, and public speakers to transition from freeze to flow. Use it before making tough decisions, starting work, or breaking out of procrastination.</p>
      <p>You don’t need a perfect routine to be productive. You just need a way to begin.</p>
