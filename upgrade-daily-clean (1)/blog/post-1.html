    <h1>Why You’re Stuck — And the One Habit That Can Rewire Your Brain</h1>
  </header>
  <main class="content">
    <p>If you’ve ever felt stuck — like your days blur together and your dreams keep getting pushed into tomorrow — you’re not alone. This isn’t laziness. It’s a neurological rut.</p>
    <p>Every time you avoid a task, scroll instead of act, or plan but don’t do — your brain is wiring itself to favor inaction. And like a muscle, that wiring gets stronger with repetition.</p>
    <p>But here’s the game-changer: you can rewire it — with one simple, daily win.</p>
    <h2>The Daily Win Principle</h2>
    <p>Each time you complete a meaningful task — no matter how small — you activate your brain’s dopamine loop. That loop rewards action, not thought.</p>
    <p>Over time, your mind begins craving momentum. The loop says: “Doing feels good.” That’s how we break paralysis and build confidence — not with giant leaps, but daily frictionless progress.</p>
    <p>This blog will show you how to tap into that every day.</p>
